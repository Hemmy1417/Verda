/**
 * The same-origin read proxy.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, measured rather than assumed. Probing StudioNet directly:
 *
 *   30 concurrent reads  ->  3 succeeded, 27 rejected
 *   reads paced 1.5s apart over 62s  ->  18 succeeded, 6 rejected
 *   error text: "Rate limit exceeded: 30 requests per minute"
 *
 * The ceiling is 30 requests per MINUTE per IP, and a single read takes about
 * 1.3 seconds. A portfolio page with eight positions needs seventeen reads; a
 * write confirming through lib/tx.ts polls thirty times on its own. Talking to
 * the RPC straight from the browser therefore does not merely risk a slow
 * page, it produces a broken one.
 *
 * Routing reads through here buys three things:
 *
 *   1. COALESCING. Everyone looking at the marketplace is asking the identical
 *      question. One upstream read answers all of them for the cache window,
 *      so the cost of a reader is close to zero.
 *   2. PACING. One place enforces the upstream budget, instead of every tab
 *      independently discovering the ceiling by hitting it.
 *   3. HONEST ERRORS. A rate-limited or erroring upstream can answer with an
 *      HTML body and no CORS headers, which reaches the browser as an opaque
 *      "Failed to fetch" that says nothing. This route always answers
 *      same-origin JSON that names what happened.
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION: the cache and the pacer are per serverless instance.
 * Vercel may run several, so the effective upstream rate is per instance, not
 * global. That is a real weakness, not a detail to gloss: it is a mitigation
 * for the read budget, not a guarantee of it. A durable shared cache would
 * need a store this build deliberately does not have.
 *
 * The numbers above were measured on StudioNet. The upstream is now GenLayer
 * Studio Next, which runs the same Studio stack and is treated as sharing the
 * ceiling until measured otherwise. Fee estimation and signing never pass
 * through here: the SDK sends them to the write client's chain URL, the real
 * RPC (see STUDIO_NEXT in lib/chain.ts), and the allowlist below refuses them.

 *
 * The status lookup exists because a contract read is not finality. A view
 * predicate turning true proves the write was ACCEPTED — a state the chain
 * can still walk back — so lib/tx.ts follows it by polling the transaction
 * itself until the chain reports FINALIZED, and those polls have to travel
 * through the same pacing and cache as every other read or they would blow
